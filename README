#### cninja - a simple generator of ninja build specs

## How To

 - Include cninja as a submodule or copy the pieces you need into your project
 - Create a `configure` script that sources cninja's `config.sh`

    #! /bin/sh

    . $(dirname $0)/cninja/config.sh

 - Specify your binaries and their sources

   bin hello-world hello-world.c


## Todo

 - auto-vendor (pull into other source tree) script for those avoiding submodules
 - A way to handle global installs
 - A general way to override pkg-config sourced libraries
 - Push config.h into build dirs!
